		ldb is a LDAP-like embedded database. It is not at all LDAP standards
		compliant, so if you want a standards compliant database then please see
		the excellent OpenLDAP project.

		What ldb does is provide a fast database with an LDAP-like API designed
		to be used within an application. In some ways it can be seen as a
		intermediate solution between key-value pair databases and a real LDAP
		database.

		ldb is the database engine used in Samba4.
